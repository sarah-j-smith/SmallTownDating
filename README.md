The concept & planning was a joint effort over 1-2 days of the
[Heartbeat game jam in January 2018](http://www.blushboxgames.com/heartbeat-program-2018/)

## Concept

The decisions we make socially, who we decide to spend time with, who we date, and who we reject; what if the consequences of those decisions were dramatically real & magnified?

Almost like instead of an enormous sea of people, all just anonymous portraits on our social media & dating apps; suddenly there were only 5 of us?
